# Open Visualisation Environment - UI

This repository contains a collection of UI components designed to be used with [Open Visualisation Environment (OVE)](https://github.com/ove/ove).

OVE is an open-source software stack, designed to be used in large high resolution display (LHRD) environments like the [Imperial College](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) [Data Science Institute's](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/) [Data Observatory](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/data-observatory/).

We welcome collaboration under our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ove/ove-ui/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

OVE needs to be installed before using OVE UIs. The [OVE Documentation](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides [installation instructions](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/INSTALLATION.html) and a [user guide](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/USAGE.html).

This repository contains the following OVE UIs:

* [Loader](packages/ove-ui-loader/README.md) - used to load OVE applications into the OVE framework.
