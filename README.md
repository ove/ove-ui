# Open Visualisation Environment - UI

This repository contains a collection of UI components designed to be used with [Open Visualisation Environment (OVE)](https://github.com/ove/ove).

These components are all browser based, and provide an alternative to using the OVE APIs directly or through one of the [OVE SDKs](http://github.com/ove/ove-sdks).

The currently available components are:

* [Demo](packages/ove-ui-demo/README.md), which launches demo scenarios on OVE
* [Launcher](packages/ove-ui-launcher/README.md), which launches OVE applications
* [Logs](packages/ove-ui-logs/README.md), which collates all components' logs.
* [Preview](packages/ove-ui-preview/README.md), which provides a preview of an OVE Space
* [Status](packages/ove-ui-status/README.md), which displays status of all OVE components

OVE must be installed before the OVE UIs can be used. The [OVE Documentation](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides [installation instructions](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/INSTALLATION.html) and a [user guide](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/USAGE.html).
