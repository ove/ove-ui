# Preview UI

This react web application can be used to preview spaces of the OVE framework one at a time. It also allows users to download corresponding commands and configurations that can be used to recreate the same space using tools such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) or SDKs such as the [Python SDK](https://github.com/ove/ove-sdks/tree/master/python).

Similar to other UIs, the preview UI can be launched either for development or in a production environment. To launch in a production environment, simply run:

```sh
npm run start
```

To launch for development, run:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```
