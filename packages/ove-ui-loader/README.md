# Loader UI

This react web application can be used to load OVE applications into the OVE framework using wizard that will guide you step-by-step. It also produces equivalent [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) commands for users who wish to use a CLI.

The loader UI can be launched either for development or in a production environment. To launch in a production environment, simply run:

```sh
npm run start
```

To launch for development, run:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```
